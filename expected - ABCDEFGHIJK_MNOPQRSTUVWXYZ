expected - ABCDEFGHIJK_MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
actual   - ABCDEF__IJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

IDEAS
 -  Will always match at start (the school)
        A
        A
 -  Consume while matching
        BCDEF
        BCDEF

 -  Read ahead to account for skipped tiles
    (Here, the vehicle skipped GH and
     immediately jumps to I, we can simply 
     resume our predictions from I)
        GHIJK
        __IJK
          ↓
         IJK

 -  When the vehicle enters an unexpected tile,
    predict on the time taken to get to 
    the nearest tile and add that time to the 
    estimate
    (Here, if N is closer to L than M, predict 
     the time to get to N and resume estimations
     from there)
        _MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
        LMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                ↓
        L→N,NOPQRSTUVWXYZ

So as we proceed, we will have generated three paths
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ (when in 1)
    ABCDEFIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ (after noticing a skip)
    ABCDEFIJKL→NOPQRSTUVWXYZ (after noticing a deviation)

But is it a deviation or a skip?
    Discovery process is the same:
        We assume it is a deviation, then if it is a skip,
        we discover the distance to rectify is 0.
        For example, going from F to I was  a deviation 
        and the nearest tile ahead was I 
        (0 seconds away from the tile deviated to)
